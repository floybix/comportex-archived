  "Builds a network of regions and senses from the given dependency

  Sensors are defined to be the form `[selector encoder]`, satisfying
  protocols PSelector and PEncoder respectively. Sensors in the
  `main-sensors` map can make activating (proximal) connections while
  those in the `motor-sensors` map can make depolarising (distal)
  connections. The same sensor may also be included in both maps.

  For each node, the combined dimensions of its feed-forward sources
  is calculated and used to set the `:input-dimensions` parameter in
  its `spec`. Also, the combined dimensions of feed-forward motor
  inputs are used to set the `:distal-motor-dimensions` parameter, and
  the combined dimensions of its feed-back superior regions is used to
  set the `:distal-topdown-dimensions` parameter. The updated spec is
  passed to a function (typically `sensory-region`) to build a
  region. The build function is found by calling `region-builders`
  with the region id keyword.

  For example to build the network `inp -> v1 -> v2`:

   `
