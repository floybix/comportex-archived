  active (either locally or globally); inhibition kicks in to reduce
  it to this level. Does not apply to temporal pooling.

  * `activation-level-max` - maximum fraction of columns that can be
  active as temporal pooling progresses. Each step of continued
  pooling allocates an extra 50% of `activation-level` until this
  maximum is reached.

  * `global-inhibition?` - whether to use the faster global algorithm
  for column inhibition (just keep those with highest overlap scores),
  or to apply local inhibition (only within a column's neighbours).

  * `inhibition-base-distance` - the distance in columns within which
  a cell *will always* inhibit neighbouring cells with lower
  excitation. Ignored if `global-inhibition?` is true.

  * `distal-vs-proximal-weight` - scaling to apply to the number of
  active distal synapses (on the winning segment) before adding to the
  number of active proximal synapses, when selecting active
  columns. Set to zero to disable ``prediction-assisted'' activation.

  * `spontaneous-activation?` - if true, cells may become active with
  sufficient distal synapse excitation, even in the absence of any
  proximal synapse excitation.

  * `dominance-margin` - an amount of excitation (generally measured
  in number of active synapses) by which one cell must exceed all
  others in the column to be considered dominant. And therefore to
  inhibit all other cells in the column.

  * `temporal-pooling-max-exc` - maximum continuing temporal pooling
  excitation level.

  * `temporal-pooling-fall` - amount by which a cell's continuing
  temporal pooling excitation falls each time step.

  * `temporal-pooling-amp` - multiplier on cell excitation to become
  persistent temporal pooling.

  * `random-seed` - the random seed (for reproducible results).

(defn within-column-cell-exc
  "Calculates cell excitation values to be used to select cells within
  columns `a-cols`; they are compared only within each column, not
  across columns. Where no segments exist, the value is
  zero. Otherwise three cases are possible:

  * For predicted cells, the distal excitation (number of active
  synapses on the most active segment) is returned.

  * A positive value is given for cells with partially-matching
  segments. This applies if any segments exist with at least
  `:seg-learn-threshold` active synapses -- even if the synapses are
  not yet connected (below the permanence threshold).  The value is
  chosen to be lower than any connected active segment: half the
  `:seg-learn-threshold`.

  * A negative value is given for cells with only inactive distal
  segments. We need this to encourage context-specific choice of cells
  in a column: avoid cells that are missing their learned context
  signal (segment). (As a biological justification, perhaps more
  segments create a larger cell surface area to lose potential?)

  The value is negatively proportional to the number of segments:
  again the unit amount is half the `:seg-learn-threshold`.

  Returns a map of cell ids to these relative excitation values."
