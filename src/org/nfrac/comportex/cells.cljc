     functionally connected. Permanence values are defined to be
     between 0 and 1.

   * `ff-perm-init-hi` - highest initial permanence value on new synapses.

   * `ff-stimulus-threshold` - minimum number of active input
     connections for a column to be _overlapping_ the input (i.e.
     active prior to inhibition).

   * `ff-max-synapse-count` - maximum number of synapses on the column.

   * `max-boost` - ceiling on the column boosting factor used to
     increase activation frequency.

   * `duty-cycle-period` - number of time steps to average over when
     updating duty cycles and (thereby) column boosting measures.

   * `boost-active-duty-ratio` - when a column's activation frequency is
     below this proportion of the _highest_ of its neighbours, its
     boost factor is increased.

   * `boost-active-every` - number of time steps between recalculating
     column boosting factors.

   * `inh-radius-every` - number of time steps between recalculating

   * `distal-punish?` - whether to reduce synapse permanence on
     distal segments incorrectly predicting activation.

   * `activation-level` - fraction of columns that can be
     active (either locally or globally); inhibition kicks in to
     reduce it to this level. Does not apply to temporal pooling.

   * `activation-level-max` - maximum fraction of columns that can be
     active as temporal pooling progresses. Each step of continued
     pooling allocates an extra 50% of `activation-level` until this
     maximum is reached.

   * `global-inhibition?` - whether to use the faster global algorithm
     for column inhibition (just keep those with highest overlap
     scores), or to apply local inhibition (only within a column's
     neighbours).

   * `inhibition-base-distance` - the distance in columns within which
     a cell *will always* inhibit neighbouring cells with lower
     excitation. Ignored if `global-inhibition?` is true.

   * `distal-vs-proximal-weight` - scaling to apply to the number of
     active distal synapses (on the winning segment) before adding to
     the number of active proximal synapses, when selecting active
     columns. Set to zero to disable ``prediction-assisted'' activation.

   * `spontaneous-activation?` - if true, cells may become active with
     sufficient distal synapse excitation, even in the absence of any
     proximal synapse excitation.

   * `dominance-margin` - an amount of excitation (generally measured
      in number of active synapses) by which one cell must exceed all
      others in the column to be considered dominant. And therefore to
      inhibit all other cells in the column.

   * `temporal-pooling-max-exc` - maximum continuing temporal pooling
     excitation level.

   * `temporal-pooling-amp` - multiplier on cell excitation to become
     persistent temporal pooling.

   * `temporal-pooling-fall` - amount by which a cell's continuing
     temporal pooling excitation falls each time step.

(defn within-column-cell-exc
  "Calculates cell excitation values to be used to select cells within
  columns `a-cols`; they are compared only within each column, not
  across columns. Where no segments exist, the value is
  zero. Otherwise three cases are possible:

  * For predicted cells, the distal excitation (number of active
  synapses on the most active segment) is returned.

  * A positive value is given for cells with partially-matching
  segments. This applies if any segments exist with at least
  `:seg-learn-threshold` active synapses -- even if the synapses are
  not yet connected (below the permanence threshold).  The value is
  chosen to be lower than any connected active segment: half the
  `:seg-learn-threshold`.

  * A negative value is given for cells with only inactive distal
  segments. We need this to encourage context-specific choice of cells
  in a column: avoid cells that are missing their learned context
  signal (segment). (As a biological justification, perhaps more
  segments create a larger cell surface area to lose potential?)

  The value is negatively proportional to the number of segments:
  again the unit amount is half the `:seg-learn-threshold`.

  Returns a map of cell ids to these relative excitation values."
